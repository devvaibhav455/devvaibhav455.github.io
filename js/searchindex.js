RTK Fixed  Q = 4  was obtained for 100 % of the time. As can be seen from the data, utmE and utmN plots are very stable with just one data point lying outside from the rest. Centimetre level accuracy is achieved overall  4.5 mm in utmE, 18.47 cm in utmN and 6.67 cm in altitude . CEP and 2DRMS values are 4.42 mm and 1.46 cm respectively which show that the data is very concentrated and hence meets the expectation.  &nbsp   2. MOVING DATA  CLEAR AREA  @ Centennial Common                          Moving data was taken at Centennial Common in the evening with clear sky conditions. RTK Fixed/ Float  Q = 4/ 5  was obtained for 97% of the time.&nbsp  Movement was done in a rectangle. Approximated curve is plotted below using MATLAB by breaking data into four segments  top, right, bottom and left . A maximum deviation of 17.37 cm from the mean altitude value is observed which can be attributed to the fact that the ground is not planar as well as change in Q value. Centimetre level accuracy is obtained in altitude which is as per expectation.                       Error is found by taking perpendicular distance from a point to the fitted curve/ line.  &nbsp   &bull  Movement is done mostly in straight line to the best of our team&rsquo s capability by defining a pathway but as can be seen from the approximated curve and statistical analysis, a maximum error of   66.10 cm is present.

The standard deviation of error is  14.73 cm. This could be attributed to the variation in GPS Fix Quality  change from RTK Fixed to RTK Float or DGPS which are less accurate  and human error in defining a straight-line path and/ or following the same.  &bull  It is also observed that as per the utmE vs utmN plot, start and end points don&rsquo t coincide.

As can be seen from the data, Q value fluctuates initially between 4  75.81% of the time , 2  0.78 % , and 5  23.4% . When Q value fluctuates, a corresponding change in utmE, utmN and altitude values is seen. These are stable when Q=4. The signals may fluctuate because of multipath/ DOP since the sensor was not in an open place.   Maximum deviation from mean value for utmE, utmN and altitude is 30.83 cm, 68.31 cm, and 2.14 m. CEP and 2DRMS values are 28.54 cm and 79.61 cm respectively which show that for 2D position, centimetre level accuracy is achieved. It is also observed that utmN varies more compared to utmE. Since RTK works best when both base and rover have a clear line of sight to the sky, but as it is not the case for this data set, expectations are met.  &nbsp   4.

So, we chose POV display.  &nbsp   Objective &nbsp To display &quot YMCA&quot  on an array of LEDs mounted on a rotating PCB.  &nbsp   Details  We were a team of four who contributed to making this project under the guidance of our college professor.  &nbsp   Key Features and tools/ resources used        Used self made kit instead of a ready-made one     Atmega32A PDIP package as a micro controller     Hall effect sensor as an interrupt sensor     Series of LEDs mounted on a PCB     DC motor for rotating the PCB     power supply was provided with a self-made AC-DC conversion unit.     Slip ring and brush assembly for power transfer to moving part    &nbsp   Everything was made from scratch on our own as we wanted to face the challenge on the hardware side as well. Motor power could have been provided easily with help of wires but we faced a challenge in providing power to PCB as it was a rotating unit. We did not use a battery to power PCB as we wanted to have more space for LEDs and micro-controller. Moreover, placing the battery was creating problems in the weight balancing of the circuit. So, we used slip ring and brush assembly for conducting electricity to the rotating PCB. IC LM7805 was used to regulate uC voltage and air cooling was naturally present in place  as the setup was rotating  to tackle the heat generated. We also used copper-enameled wire to connect LEDs with a micro-controller to reduce the weight of the overall PCB assembly. These were the hardware challenges that we faced.  &nbsp   On the software side, it required a lot of effort in programming the code as the timing after which LEDs need to be turned ON after interrupt was a crucial factor in its working. We adjusted timing multiple times so that the text that we intended to display on it was readable. Through many attempts, we were finally able to make this setup reliable and working. In the end, &quot YMCA&quot   our college name  was displayed on it.   &nbsp   We faced many mechanical and electronics challenges in making this project and learned how to tackle and solve them. It was also a test of our patience as we faced many failed attempts while making it.  &nbsp   Back to projects  &nbsp               HomeProjectsContact              DEV VAIBHAV  Aspiring Roboticist                    Copyright &copy  2022 by &quot Dev Vaibhav&quot &nbsp  &middot &nbsp  All Rights reserved&nbsp  &middot &nbsp  E-Mail  vaibhav.dev5@gmail.com   LinkedIn   GitHub           ", "");

E.g. Automatic light switch using a light sensor, people counter using a motion sensor, clap switch using sound sensor and temperature display monitor &amp  automatic fan controller using temperature sensor. It involved reading analog data from the sensors and with help of Analog to Digital Converter  ADC , this data was fed to a micro-controller. To do the required task, the uC was programmed using the C programming language.   &nbsp   Through this project, I came to know about various sensors, their working, and applications that can help us in our daily life through these projects.  &nbsp   &nbsp   Back to projects  &nbsp               HomeProjectsContact              DEV VAIBHAV  Aspiring Roboticist              Copyright &copy  2022 by &quot Dev Vaibhav&quot &nbsp  &middot &nbsp  All Rights reserved&nbsp  &middot &nbsp  E-Mail  vaibhav.dev5@gmail.com   LinkedIn   GitHub           ", "");

When used in the astable mode both the frequency and duty cycle of the output waveform can be accurately controlled to produce a very versatile waveform generator. This signal was fed to the buzzer which produced sound corresponding to the frequency that is fed to it. Resistors of suitable value can be used accordingly to produce frequencies corresponding to Sa-re-ga-ma-pa. This project was a blend of art and technology. At this time, we did not know the way to make this using CAD tools as it was our first electronics project in college.&nbsp  So, we made the design on butter paper using a marker and ruler and did the whole process manually. It enabled us to gain basic knowledge of electronics circuits and IC operation.  &nbsp   References  https //www.electronics-tutorials.ws/waveforms/555_timer.html,&nbsp https //electrosome.com/electronic-piano-555-timer/  &nbsp   Back to projects  &nbsp               HomeProjectsContact              DEV VAIBHAV  Aspiring Roboticist              Copyright &copy  2022 by &quot Dev Vaibhav&quot &nbsp  &middot &nbsp  All Rights reserved&nbsp  &middot &nbsp  E-Mail  vaibhav.dev5@gmail.com   LinkedIn   GitHub        555 Timer IC Block diagram    555 Timer IC in Astable multivibrator mode    Toy Piano circuit diagram       ", "");

I used a step-down transformer and a full bridge diode rectifier with a capacitor  2200 uF  filter to supply DC to IC LM317T. Adjustable output was then fed to the trimmer with help of wires. Through this, I came to know and design simple circuits using CAD  Computer-Aided Design  tools like Proteus and Orcad.
